# Patient Medication Adherence Analysis Using Spark-Scala

# Goal:
Build a batch processing pipeline using Apache Spark with Scala that:

Ingests patient medication data (e.g. prescriptions, fill dates)

Identifies medication adherence patterns (who is skipping doses, late refills, etc.)

Outputs reports for potential follow-up or intervention
