# Patient Medication Adherence Analysis Using Spark-Scala in Databricks.

# Goal:
Build a batch processing pipeline using Apache Spark with Scala that:
Use Spark (Scala) on Databricks to analyze patient medication refill data, compute adherence metrics like MPR (Medication Possession Ratio), and identify patients who may need intervention.
Ingests patient medication data (e.g. prescriptions, fill dates)
Identifies medication adherence patterns (who is skipping doses, late refills, etc.)
Outputs reports for potential follow-up or intervention
